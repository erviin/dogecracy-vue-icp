# `vue`

Welcome to your new `vue` project and to the Internet Computer development community. By default, creating a new project adds this README and some template files to your project directory. You can edit these template files to customize your project and to include your own code to speed up the development cycle.

To get started, you might want to explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.

To learn more before you start working with `vue`, see the following documentation available online:

- [Quick Start](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)
- [Motoko Programming Language Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/motoko)
- [Motoko Language Quick Reference](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/language-manual)


If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd vue/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running this project locally

If you want to test this project locally, you can use the following commands:
make sure you can run bash script

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
sh backend.sh
```
check .env file copy the value of  `CANISTER_ID_VUE_BACKEND` copy it to `/src/vue_backend/ICRC1/Canisters/Token.mo` on line 20
``` 
let appCanister = actor("YOUR_CANISTER_ID_VUE_BACKEND") : actor {
        donate : shared (caller:Principal, txIndex:Nat, args:FundRaiseTypes.DonationArgs) -> async Text;
    };
```
save it,
next is deploying our token but before 
run `dfx identity get-principal` you will see your identity 
paste in token.sh  on line 10 `  owner = principal "YOUR_PRINCIPAL_TEXT";    `
save and run 
```
sh token.sh
```

```
sh frontend.sh
```

you can start develop by running `npm start`

and login with internet identity.

once you logged in you will see your principal text inside you profile, inspect the element to see full

with that you can start transfer token to that account by updating transfer.sh on line 4 `owner = principal \"YOUR_PRINCIPAL_FROM_FRONTEND\";`
save and run
```
sh transfer.sh
```
once completed you will have 1.000.000 token



### DEVELOPMENT
If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
